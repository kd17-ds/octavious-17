        <h2>SSDs based Drone</h2>

        1. Higher Speed: SSDs provide faster read/write speeds compared to SD
        cards, enabling quicker storage and retrieval of data. This is
        particularly beneficial for high-resolution video recording (e.g.,
        4K/8K) and real-time processing.<br /><br />

        2. Increased Capacity: SSDs generally offer larger storage capacities
        compared to SD cards, which can be limited in size. This allows for
        longer recording times without needing to swap storage.<br /><br />

        3. Enhanced Durability: SSDs are more robust and resistant to physical
        shocks and vibrations, which is advantageous in drones operating in
        harsh environments.<br /><br />

        4. Better Performance for High-End Applications: SSDs are ideal for
        drones involved in tasks like aerial mapping, surveying, or live
        broadcasting, where large amounts of data need to be handled
        efficiently.<br /><br />

        5. Reduced Bottlenecks in Data Transfer: SSDs minimize delays in data
        transfer, ensuring smooth operation during data-intensive tasks like
        real-time analytics or AI-based obstacle avoidance.<br /><br />

        6. Improved Reliability: SSDs are less prone to data corruption or
        failure compared to SD cards, which can wear out faster due to repeated
        read/write cycles.<br /><br />

        <h2>SDs based Drones</h2>
        1. Processing Overhead SD-based systems rely on extensive software
        processing, which can lead to latency, especially in real-time
        applications such as obstacle avoidance or high-speed navigation.<br /><br />

        2. Dependency on Connectivity Many SD-based drones rely on stable
        network connections for updates, controls, or data sharing. Poor
        connectivity can result in degraded performance or operational
        failure.<br /><br />

        3. Complexity in Development The integration and management of
        software-defined systems are complex. Errors in code or software bugs
        can lead to system crashes or unexpected behavior during flights.<br /><br />

        4. Power Consumption Increased reliance on sophisticated software
        components requires powerful processors, which consume more energy,
        reducing flight time.<br /><br />

        5. Cybersecurity Risks Software reliance increases vulnerability to
        hacking or malware attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized control
        or data theft.<br /><br />

        6. Limited Hardware Integration Compatibility issues between SD-based
        platforms and hardware components can restrict the performance or
        capabilities of the drone.
